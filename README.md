CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

The steps followed in the code are documented by comments in the code as follows 
- Download data
- Read and Convert Data
- Merges the Training and Testing Sets into 1 data set called data.all
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
